I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Dan Negrut, for his support, advice and guidance.  I would like to thank those from whom I have learned over the years, including Professor Negrut, Dr. Radu Serban, Dr. Arman Pazouki, and  Dr. Antonio Recuero. I would like to thank Mr. Asher Elmquest for many insightful discussions we have had on a daily basis. I would like to thank the system administrator of the Euler supercomputer, Mr. Colin Vanden Heuvel, for his support. I would also like to thank the committee members for sharing their expertise and for their time.
Above all, I would like to thank my family, without whom this work would not have been possible.
