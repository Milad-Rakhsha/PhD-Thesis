\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
Computer simulation has opened up new research directions in many engineering and physical sciences. The increased reliance of engineers and scientists on computer modeling and simulation stems primarily from the relatively high cost of conducting experimental studies. Harnessing the power of today's computers to carry out billions of operations per second can translate in some cases in replacing large amounts of experimental work with effective computer simulation. In terms of continuum mechanics, current numerical methods can simulate problems with millions of degrees of freedom. Similarly, simulating the dynamics of many discrete systems with a relatively large number of degrees of freedom is possible. However, computer simulation of (i) multidisciplinary problems featuring the coupling of discrete systems and continua, and (ii) large scale discrete systems encountered in granular media continue to pose many and interesting challenges.

\section{Problem Statement}
Problems involving the interaction of multiple physical phenomena are prevalent in many engineering applications, ranging from biomechanics to geomechanics. Modeling and simulation of soft tissues or cardiovascular flows are prime examples of multi-physics problems in biomechanics. Many environmental applications concerning renewable energy devices, offshore wind turbines, etc., require modeling the dynamics of fluids, solids, and their interaction. Lastly, a multi-physics modeling and simulation capability is required in geomechanics problems encountered in partially saturated soil or landslides.   

From the computational perspective, simulation of discrete systems poses a higher computational burden comparing to continuum modeling. For instance, discrete modeling of soil and granular media leads to extremely large problems due to the small particle size and/or the large number of particles in many real-world problems. A continuum approximation of these systems could lead to more efficient solvers, yet the success of the homogenization process is dictated by the predictive attribute of suitably chosen constitutive laws. The interest in this Ph.D. thesis is in modeling the dynamics of both discrete and continuum systems as well as their coupling, and, when possible, to use the continuum approach to approximate discrete systems.

The problems of interest in this work span multiple disciplines across continuum and discrete systems as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Overview}. These problems include dynamics of (i) fluids, (ii) rigid and flexible multi-body systems, and (iii) fluid-solid interaction problems where dynamics of a continuum is coupled with discrete flexible or rigid multi-body systems. Owing to their multi-physics nature, these three thrusts cover a wide range of real-world applications that span multiple disciplines and industries.

\section{Thesis Overview}
This manuscript is organized as follows: Chapter \ref{chap:background} will provide a brief overview of the existing work and literature on computational fluid dynamics, multi-body dynamics, and fluid-solid interaction. Chapters \ref{chap:discrete_Model} and \ref{chap:continua_Model} will discuss the modeling aspects and the numerical methods for solving the governing equations of discrete and continuous systems, respectively. Details about the software implementation of the  framework are presented in Chapter \ref{chap:implementation}, with numerical experiments and validation discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:experiments}. Chapter \ref{chap:demonstration} presents several applications and demonstrates the capabilities of the developed computational framework. Conclusions and directions of future work are discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}.
